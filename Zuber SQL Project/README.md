Description:
6 Step SQL query.
Exploratory data analysis and investigation whether the duration of rides from the Loop to O'Hare International Airport changes on rainy Saturdays.
Purpose was to find patterns in the available information from competitors to understand passenger preferences and the impact of external factors on rides.
Assumptions:
There isn't a direct connection between the trips table and weather_records table in the database.
neighborhood_id is the Primary Key for the neighborhoods table.
cab_id is the Primary Key for the cabs table.
trip_id is the Primary Key for the trips table.
record_id is the Primary Key for the weather_records table.
Process:
Analyzed taxi rides by company for specific dates, sorting by trip count. Analyzed rides for companies containing specific keywords, grouping by company name. Retrieved neighborhood IDs for O'Hare and Loop. Categorized weather conditions by hour. Retrieved Saturday rides from Loop to O'Hare, including weather and duration. Sorted the results.
